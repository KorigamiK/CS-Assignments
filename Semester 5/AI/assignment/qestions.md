# Comparison and Critical Analysis of:

- 1-11 : Continuous vs Discrete Data in ML
- 12-22 :  classification vs regression in ML
- 23-33 : tree vs knn and linear regression vs neural network 
- 34-44 : Normalization vs 0-1 Normalization (Min-Max Scaling) vs Standardization
- 45-55 :  dimensionality reduction PCA and K-Means Clustering 
- 56-66Â : Feature Selection: F-test and MRMR( Minimum Redundancy and Maximum Relevance)
