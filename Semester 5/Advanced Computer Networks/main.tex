\section{IP Address Classes}
\label{sec:ipclass}
\subsection{Objective}
To identify the class of an IP address.
\subsection{Theory}
In IPv4, IP addresses are divided into five classes: A, B, C, D, and E. Each
class has its own range of valid IP addresses and is used for specific
purposes.

\begin{enumerate}[label=\textbf{Class \Alph*:}, leftmargin=2cm]
	\item \begin{itemize}
		      \item Range: 1.0.0.0 to 126.255.255.255
		      \item Subnet Mask: 255.0.0.0
		      \item Address Allocation: Class A addresses are typically used by large organizations and corporations. They can support a very large number of hosts on a single network.
	      \end{itemize}
	      
	\item \begin{itemize}
		      \item Range: 128.0.0.0 to 191.255.255.255
		      \item Subnet Mask: 255.255.0.0
		      \item Address Allocation: Class B addresses are used by medium-sized organizations. They offer a moderate number of network and host addresses.
	      \end{itemize}
	      
	\item \begin{itemize}
		      \item Range: 192.0.0.0 to 223.255.255.255
		      \item Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0
		      \item Address Allocation: Class C addresses are commonly used by small organizations and businesses. They provide a limited number of network addresses but a larger number of host addresses.
	      \end{itemize}
	      
	\item \begin{itemize}
		      \item Range: 224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255
		      \item Address Allocation: Class D addresses are reserved for multicast groups and are not used for traditional unicast communication. They are used for one-to-many or many-to-many communication.
	      \end{itemize}
	      
	\item \begin{itemize}
		      \item Range: 240.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255
		      \item Address Allocation: Class E addresses are reserved for experimental or research purposes and are not typically used in public networks. They are reserved for future use and not intended for general use.

\section{Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR)}
\label{sec:cidr}

\subsection{Objective}
To find the subnet mask, network address, and broadcast address of a given IP

\subsection{Theory}
Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) is an IP addressing scheme that improves
the allocation of IP addresses and routing efficiency on the Internet. It
allows for more flexible allocation of IP addresses than the original system of
IP address classes (Class A, B, and C). CIDR is based on variable-length subnet
masking (VLSM), which enables IP addresses to be allocated based on the actual
need, rather than predefined classes.

CIDR addresses are written in the form IP\_address/prefix\_length. For example,
$192.168.1.0/24$ represents a CIDR address where the first $24$ bits are the
network address, and the remaining 8 bits are available for host addresses.

\subsection{Source Code}

\inputminted[firstline=9, fontsize=\footnotesize]{cpp}{code/cidr.cpp}

\subsection{Output}

\begin{lstlisting}[style=output]
$ code git:(main) ./cidr
Network Address: 192.168.1.0/24
Network Address: 10.0.0.0/8
Network Address: 172.16.0.0/12
192.168.1.1 is within the CIDR address ranges.
10.1.2.3 is within the CIDR address ranges.
172.16.1.1 is within the CIDR address ranges.
8.8.8.8 is NOT within the CIDR address ranges.

\section{Distance Vector Routing Algorithm}
\label{sec:Distance Vector Routing Algorithm}

\subsection{Objective}
To implement the Distance-Vector Routing algorithm.

\subsection{Theory}
A distance-vector routing (DVR) protocol requires that a router inform its
neighbors of topology changes periodically. Historically known as the old
\textbf{\textit{ARPANET}} routing algorithm or known as \textbf{\textit{Bellman-Ford}} algorithm.

Each router maintains a Distance Vector table containing the distance between
itself and \textit{all} possible destination nodes. Distances, based on a
chosen metric, are computed using information from the neighbors' distance
vectors.


\subsection{Information Kept by DV Router}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Each router has an ID.
	\item Associated with each link connected to a router, there is a link cost
	      (static or dynamic).
	\item Intermediate hops.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Distance Vector Table Initialization}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Distance to itself = 0
	\item Distance to all other routers = infinity number.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Distance Vector Algorithm}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item A router transmits its distance vector to each of its neighbors in a
	      routing packet.
	\item Each router receives and saves the most recently received distance
	      vector from each of its neighbors.
	\item A router recalculates its distance vector when:
	      \begin{itemize}
		      \item It receives a distance vector from a neighbor containing
		            different information than before.
		      \item It discovers that a link to a neighbor has gone down.
	      \end{itemize}
	\item The DV calculation is based on minimizing the cost to each destination:
	      \begin{align*}
		       & Dx(y) = \text{Estimate of least cost from x to y}               \\
		       & C(x,v) = \text{Node x knows cost to each neighbor v}            \\
		       & Dx = [Dx(y): y \in N] = \text{Node x maintains distance vector} \\
		       & \text{Node x also maintains its neighbors' distance vectors:}   \\
		       & \text{For each neighbor v, x maintains } Dv = [Dv(y): y \in N]
	      \end{align*}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Bellman-Ford Algorithm}
\label{sec:Bellman-Ford Algorithm}

\subsection{Objective}
To implement the Bellman-Ford algorithm to find the shortest path
in a weighted graph.

\subsection{Theory}
The Bellman-Ford algorithm is used to find the shortest paths from a 
single source vertex to all other vertices in a weighted graph, even when the
graph contains negative weight edges. While it's not the most efficient
algorithm for all cases (especially for graphs with non-negative weights, where
Dijkstra's algorithm is typically faster),

\section{Dijkstra's Algorithm}
\label{sec:Dijkstra's Algorithm}

\subsection{Objective}
To implement Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path
in a weighted graph.

\subsection{Theory}
Dijkstra's algorithm is an algorithm for finding the shortest paths between
nodes in a graph, which may represent, for example, road networks. It was
conceived by computer scientist Edsger W. Dijkstra in 1956 and published three
years later.

Its time complexity is $O(|E| + |V| \log |V|)$, where $|E|$ is the number of
edges and $|V|$ is the number of vertices. However, this algorithm is only
applicable to graphs with positive edge weights.
