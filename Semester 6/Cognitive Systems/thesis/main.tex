\chapter{Knowledge Representation}

Data is like Lego blocks for the cognitive system, if our cognitive system can
learn to organize or put these blocks together into correct places then it is
termed as information, if this structure of data (blocks) can be used for
future use it is termed as knowledge.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Data}: Raw facts, figures, data that does not mean anything
    independently, much like individual LEGO blocks.

  \item \textbf{Information}: When data is organized, structured, or given
    context, it becomes information. Much like fitting LEGO blocks into a
    structure. Information gives logic, meaning, and allows us/cognitive
    systems to understand how to use these blocks. This is like creating a
    house or a spaceship model using the LEGO.

  \item \textbf{Knowledge}: When this structure of blocks (Information) can be
    understood, applied, and can be used for future use, it becomes knowledge.
    This is similar to having a LEGO creation that can be changed, extended, or
    reused in different ways.

  \item \textbf{Knowledge Representation}: Imagine now writing detailed
    instructions on how to assemble the LEGO structure just like before. This
    step-by-step instructions will guide us to assemble the structure just as
    before by providing instructions on how to put the LEGO together to
    construct that structure. They store the relation between the blocks, the
    proper sequence for assembly, and any other relevant details required to
    reconstruct the structure.
\end{enumerate}

\section{How is Knowledge Represented}

Let's consider the example of the healthcare industry, where a huge volume of
data is generated and needs to be stored on a daily basis. This data includes
digital health records (DHRs), Medical imaging data (MRI, X-Ray, ECG, etc.),
lab reports, prescriptions, clinical notes, genetic and hereditary information,
and much more.

In this section, we discuss how this data is represented in such a way that it
becomes knowledge and can be used in the future.

\subsection{Structured Data}

Data such as DHR, lab reports, medical history is stored in a structured
manner, that is, they follow a certain predefined structure. This data can be
easily queried and analyzed as it can be stored easily in a RDBMS (Relational
Database Management System). This data allows a cognitive system to derive info
easily, extract insights to support diagnosis.

	\caption{Types of Knowledge Representation}\label{fig:types}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Taxonomies}

\textbf{Definition}: Taxonomy is a hierarchical classification model that is
used to categorize entities/objects based on their similarities and
differences.

\textbf{Example}

\textbf{Disease Taxonomies}:

Taxonomies organize diseases and medical conditions based on the hierarchy of
diseases and affected organ systems. Disease classifications assist in patient
condition analysis, support clinical decision, and disease management,
enhancing patient care and outcomes.

\subsection{Ontologies}

We need structured mechanisms to derive relationships, concepts, and logic.
Ontologies allow us to store and represent concepts and their relationships
within a given domain.

\textbf{Ontologies in Familial History}:

When a patient like John visits a healthcare provider and mentions his family's
medical history, ontologies play a crucial role in organizing and utilizing
this information. For example, John might mention that his father had diabetes
and his mother had cardiovascular disease. An ontology designed for familial
history would define relationships between family members, genetic
predispositions, and medical conditions. By annotating John's family history
data according to this ontology, it becomes semantically interoperable.
Healthcare providers can then assess John's risk factors for certain medical
conditions based on his familial history, guiding preventive measures and
treatment decisions. Additionally, aggregating familial history data using
standardized ontologies enables population-level analysis and research, leading
to a better understanding of genetic patterns and more effective healthcare
strategies.

\subsection{Textual Data}

A lot of data such as clinical notes, medical literature, research papers,
etc., are in text-based formats which are unstructured and may contain hidden
patterns and context. This data requires Natural Language Processing (NLP) for
it to be fully utilized and extract relevant info such as patients' medical
context, or research findings, or expert opinions, and historical
moves/comments about a similar situation.

\section[Applications of Knowledge Representation]{Applications of \\Knowledge Representation}

Certainly, here are five applications of knowledge representation with concise
explanations:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Robotics}: Robots need to understand their environment; this
    allows them to perform tasks and collaborate with humans. Knowledge
    representation techniques allow robots to represent this data efficiently.

  \item \textbf{Knowledge Management}: Many systems need information from
    various sources, with different formats. Using ontologies and knowledge
    graphs allows these systems to use this data efficiently and make decisions
    based on them.

  \item \textbf{Recommendation Systems}: Using knowledge representation
    techniques such as knowledge graphs, a recommendation system uses various
    attributes for recommending different products, services, or content such
    as movies and series.
\end{enumerate}

\chapter{Knowledge Representation in Cognitive Systems}

As discussed in the previous chapter, Knowledge is data that has been given
structure and can be used in the future. Knowledge representation is a crucial
part of any cognitive system. The knowledge base, where all this knowledge is
stored in such a way that it is interlinked, and their relationship between the
data is clearly mentioned. Cognitive systems continuously learn with experience
and from the environment, hence a knowledge base system for it must support
\textbf{Continuous Learning}.

\section{Data Collection and Storage Strategies for Cognitive Systems}

Data is the fundamental building block, as discussed in Chapter 3. Cognitive
systems collect this data from various sources such as sensors, existing
databases, paid/free public APIs, web scraping, and crowdsourcing.

\subsection{Data Collection}

Using the example of a healthcare Cognitive system, let's see how these various
sources contribute to the data for the CS:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textit{Sensors}: Metrics like heart-rate, blood pressure, and sleep
    patterns can be collected using wearable devices, which allow deeper
    insights into patients' health. Chronic diseases can be monitored in a much
    better way using devices such as continuous glucose monitors for diabetes.
  \item \textit{Existing Databases}: EHR and public patient databases allow
    hospitals and medical personnel to access medical history, running
    medication, and ongoing treatment resulting in faster and more efficient
    management of patient care.
  \item \textit{APIs (Application Programming Interfaces)}: Public APIs allow
    systems to collect data directly from third-party data providers and
    healthcare applications and devices.
  \item \textit{Web Scraping}: This technique allows systems to collect data
    from websites such as online medical journals, research papers, and medical
    publications.
  \item \textit{Crowdsourcing}: Platforms use forms and questionnaires to
    collect user data such as symptoms, doctor ratings/reviews, and experiences
    such as side effects to create an extensive knowledge base.
\end{enumerate}

After this data is collected, it needs to be cleaned and stored.

\subsection{Data Pre-processing}

This collected data needs to be processed before storing it in a knowledge
graph. This may include cleaning missing values, removing outliers,
normalization, and feature selection.

\subsection{Data Storage}

Following steps may be taken to store this data:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Schema Matching}: A schema must be decided, and data needs to
    be fixed into it. A schema must be defined for each individual source. This
    can be done by mapping similar attributes together.
  \item \textbf{Semantic Analysis}: Data contains context and relationships
    among itself. This needs to be represented in the knowledge base to allow
    the cognitive system to find the correct entity and its relation with other
    data. For example, consider a clinical note that mentions a patient. The
    cognitive system must be able to understand this real-life entity as the
    patient it knows from its knowledge base. This would allow it to get all
    the related data to the patient themselves and better extract insights from
    the note.
\end{itemize}

\section{Knowledge Representation in Cognitive System Databases}

After data collection and preprocessing, it needs to be represented in the
cognitive system databases. This can be done in the following ways:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Semantic Representation}: Traditional databases like RDBMS
    cannot represent complex relationships and capture the context of the data.
    Hence, we need a semantic representation of the data using techniques such
    as Knowledge Graphs. For example, the relationship between disease,
    symptoms, and treatment may be stored in ontologies. This allows the
    cognitive systems to draw diseases from symptoms, find treatments allowing
    better care for the patients.
  \item \textbf{Custom Knowledge Schemas}: Custom schemas create a better way
    to organize knowledge to better utilize this knowledge. Taxonomies can be
    used to store familial data allowing to store and see what disease someone
    may be predisposed to because of their parents and grandparents.
  \item \textbf{Multi-format Data}: Various formats may be needed to store such
    as textual reports, Medical images such as X-Rays MRIs etc. Patient's
    medical reports, X-rays, and other reports need to be stored along with
    their diagnosis; this is done using vector embedding, deep learning
    Techniques.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Enabling Continuous Learning in Cognitive Systems}

Healthcare is an ever-growing industry; every day new research, diseases,
treatments, and medications are found, hence we need to create a cognitive
system that can adapt to such an environment. Hence, we need to deploy adaptive
systems.

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Continuous Learning Algorithm}: Neural networks and other deep
    learning techniques are employed in cognitive systems, but these should be
    incrementally learning. That is, they should be able to update the
    knowledge base without requiring the model to retrain algorithms as an
    industry like healthcare is very dynamic. For example, a CS monitoring
    blood sugar should be able to learn new trends in blood sugar of patients
    to maintain accuracy hence the new data must be stored and learned
    incrementally.
  \item \textbf{Dynamic Memory Structure}: Traditional storage and memory
    architecture may become overwhelmed with the ever-growing data that is
    generated in real-time. Hence, we need a memory system that can handle and
    store the data based on its relevance, recency, and contextual importance.
    We may use priority-based storage systems witch store the recent data like
    recent patient history or symptoms based on the current case in the faster
    memory like cache. For example, patients that are currently admitted to the
    hospital, their data would be given more priority in the memory.
\end{itemize}

\section{Security Concerns}

Knowledge base and cognitive system databases store private data of users
(Medical data), important research papers, and other related data. To maintain
the privacy of users and prevent malicious entities from accessing the data,
security measures such as encryption, access control, and view management.

To maintain security and privacy of data and users can be done by following
methods:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Encryption}: Methods like end-to-end encryption can be used to
    prevent accessing of data without authorization.
  \item \textbf{Minimal Data Collection}: The minimum amount of data, that is
    only necessary data for the functionality of the cognitive system should be
    collected from users.
  \item \textbf{Adding Noise while Storing Data}: Is done so that the data can
    still be used to train models but not make out any personal data.
  \item \textbf{Anonymization of Data}: Personal data of users must be
    protected to ensure that any data that is vulnerable should not contain
    users' personal details. This can also be done by differential privacy
    methods which use mathematical frameworks to ensure information about a
    specific person/user is not revealed.
  \item \textbf{Proper Access Control Mechanisms}: Role-based access control
    should be employed, i.e., people with certain roles/posts can only access
    certain data. For example, a doctor can access the data of a patient, but
    only when the patient is in the appointment with the doctor.
  \item \textbf{Auditing and Threat Detection}: Regular audits and security
    checks should be done to ensure that there is no suspicious activity
    happening. Threat detection should be done actively to detect any
    intrusions or attacks.
\end{itemize}

\chapter{Conclusion and emerging trends}

As we have shown, knowledge representation is a crucial aspect of cognitive
systems. It allows us to store, organize, and use data efficiently. Knowledge
representation techniques such as ontologies, taxonomies, and knowledge graphs
are used in various industries and applications. They help us understand the
relationships between entities in a domain, infer new knowledge from the data,
and discover new relationships between entities. Knowledge representation is a
rapidly evolving field, and we can expect to see more advancements in the
future.
